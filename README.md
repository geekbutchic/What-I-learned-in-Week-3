 All our code ran in the global scope, from top to bottom, as soon as it was called. 

* We further expanded from indices and used what is known as process.argv [ ], which is used to get the arguments passed to the node. js process when run in the command line.
* Beginning with process.argv[2] we can respond in the command line depending on how the user responds.  
* *"Welcome Please Login!"*

We continued to hone our functions that further expanded our knowledge base on booleans.  For example if the user is both logged in and an administrator we could call a boolean function that would show the adminstration page.  If they are logged in and a student a different web page would pop up.  
* Booleans 
* Else if 
* Returns

Now that we were able to build our back-end functions.  We started to introduce some front-end interface.
* We used tools such as flow charts.  These helped tremendously with understanding which console.log scripts we were going to print out depending on what variables where inputted by the user.

Lastly we followed up with functions called **"Loops".** 
* Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return *true* or *false* when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns *false*.
* The loops we started with were called **(while loops)** - through a block of code while a specified condition is *true*.  The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is *true*. It will only stop when the condition becomes *false*.
